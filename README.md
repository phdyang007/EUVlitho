# EUVlitho
EUVlitho includes the following two program sets.
1. EUV lithography simulator based on the 3D waveguide model
2. CNN fitting to M3D parameters
## Requirements
EUV lithography simulator depends on MKL, Eigen, CUDA and MAGMA.

CNN depends on Pytorch Ligtning.
## 1. EUV lithography simulator
For the theoretical backgrond of the simulation please read the following paper.
- H. Tanabe, A. Junguji and A. Takahashi, "Weakly guiding approximation of a three dimentional waveguide model for extreme ultraviolet lithography simulation," JOSA A 41(2024)1491.

Main program is emint/intensity.cpp. Please modify the makefile (makeint).
The input is the mask pattern (mask.csv) and the output is the image intensity (emint.csv). The optical and absorber settings are written in intensity.cpp. The ML setting is written in ampS in include/header.h which follows the paper by N. Davydova et al. (SPIE 88860A). Usually you do not need to modify this subroutine. The mask pattern can be generated by mask/mask.cpp but you can generate it by yourself. Below is an example of the output image intensity. We use Graph-R to plot the image intensity but you can use any plottng software.
