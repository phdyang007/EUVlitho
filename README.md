# EUVlitho
EUVlitho includes the following two program sets.
1. EUV lithography simulator based on the 3D waveguide model
2. CNN fitting to M3D parameters
## Prerequisites
EUV lithography simulator depends on MKL, Eigen and Magma.

CNN fitting depends on Pytorch Ligtning.
## 1. EUV lithography simulator
For the theoretical backgrond of the simulation please read the following paper.

H. Tanabe, A. Junguji and A. Takahashi, "Weakly guiding approximation of a three dimentional waveguide model for extreme ultraviolet lithography simulation," JOSA A 41(2024)1491.
